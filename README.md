# tournaman-aux

This is a helper programme for the debating software Tournaman. It parses
Tournaman's internal data and processes it. Currently, it generates feedback
sheets pre-filled with the participants' information. The programme is not
really intended for public consumption, so no docs beyond this point. (Ask me
if you want some.)
